# flaskblog

Get started with Flask and practice my Python skills:

**Blog Application**: 
Create a simple blogging platform where users can create accounts, write posts, and view other users' posts. 
Some features to implement include:
-User registration and login
-Create, update, and delete posts
-Display posts by date, author, or tags
-Add comments to posts

This project will help me practice working with user authentication, database management, and CRUD operations in Flask.
